Problems faced:

- "Drag and Drop" is a really finicky mechanic and it seems to be a large problem space with many libraries.
    - if i had more time i would love to try other libraries such as dnd kit
- storing cards is difficult because there are so many elements to them, color, cost, type.
    - So figuring out what is important was key
- developing UI was easily the hardest part
    - I am still very new to react so it took a lot longer to create my first pages
- sometimes it was difficult to determine if my issue was from my back or front end
    - though by the end of it I was learning some tips and tricks for debugging
- there are definitely some bugs that I just couldn't figure out and I felt it was important to make sure whole site is flushed out before going too deep into a bug or two
